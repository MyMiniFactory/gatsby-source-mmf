# gatsby-source-mmf

This plugin sets up source for Gatsby application fetching data from MyMiniFactory API

## Install plugin

To install the plugin, follow these steps.

1. Gatsby loads plugins from the your local website plugins folder which is a folder named `plugins` in the websiteâ€™s root directory. So place the plugin folder inside it.

2. Ensure that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed. This provides dependencies to run the plugin.

3. From the plugin folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

## Configure the plugin

Open `gatsby-config.js` from the root directory of your tutorial site, and add the gatsby-source-mmf plugin inside plugin table:

```javascript
plugins: [
  ...,
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-source-mmf",
    options: {
      key: "<API-KEY>",
      cat: "112",
      per_page: "16",
      light: "1",
    },
  },
]
```
## Query for result

Your plugin is ready. Start `gatsby develop` and open a browser at http://localhost:8000/___graphql. The MyMiniFactory data can be queried from here. try:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  allMyMiniFactoryObject {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        url
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
